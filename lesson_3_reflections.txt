When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It could happen that when, doing it automatically, a lot of people make 
    changes to the repository and it could change the files in your working 
    directory, bringing changes that, maybe, we woudn't want to add. Whereas, 
    doing it manually you could see all the changes that would be add to your 
    working directory.
