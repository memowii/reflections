When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It would be when I wanted to share my projects with other people. Using 
    GitHub I think that taks is easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It could happen that when, doing it automatically, a lot of people make 
    changes to the repository and it could change the files in your working 
    directory, bringing changes that, maybe, we woudn't want to add. Whereas, 
    doing it manually you could see all the changes that would be add to your 
    working directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Like Sara has said before forks are like clones but these only works
    	   in the GitHub's machines. When you make a fork you create a copy of
    	   a repository in your own GitHub account.
    Clones: The clones ocurred just when you clone a repository to your own 
    	    machine, or you make several clones of a repository in a physical
    	    machine.
   	Branches: These are created when we want to make other kind of 
   			  implementations to our code, then we can create a branch and make
   			  all the changes that we would like to do. And go on with more
   			  implementations.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
