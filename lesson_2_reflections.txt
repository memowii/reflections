What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	In the moment I initialize a repository a hidden file is createad (inside the folder you are) called .git.
	I need to do that because that is way that git works, in other way I think that you won't be able to use git 
	and all its characteristics.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	I think that the staging area is a special place where you put the files that will be committed.
	The staging area could be helpful to know exactly what files should be committed.
