What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	In the moment I initialize a repository a hidden file is createad (inside the folder you are) called .git.
	I need to do that because that is way that git works, in other way I think that you won't be able to use git 
	and all its characteristics.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	I think that the staging area is a special place where you put the files that will be committed.
	The staging area could be helpful to know exactly what files should be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	The staging area could be use like a "pre-commit" because that is the place where we put the things that will be committed.
	So every logical change will be put there, and in the moment we feel that it is correct we will make the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	I think that branches would be helpful when we want to apply different ideas to a project. With their help you can create several branches
	and watch how your ideas look like. If that idea didn't work for us, then we could easily go back to the branch master. Or in the case that we would like
	the new changes we could merge those changes to the branch master.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	They are helpful because I can join different branches of the same project to see how this is composed and see how the different persons has
	contributed to it. And it is also a map to know what is going to be merged.
